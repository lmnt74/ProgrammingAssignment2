##this file is create a Cache Matrix and then reference it back in the event that a matrix
##is already stored with the same name

## makeCacheMatrix is supposed to take a matrix and cache it

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}

## cacheSolve is supposed to inverse the function if it hasn't already been inversed

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
